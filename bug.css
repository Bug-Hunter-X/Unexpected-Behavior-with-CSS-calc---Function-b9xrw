The CSS property `calc()` can sometimes produce unexpected results if not used carefully. For instance, combining `calc()` with percentages and other units requires precise understanding of how the browser resolves the calculation.  A common error is forgetting the spaces around the operators within the `calc()` function, leading to incorrect calculations. Another subtle issue involves using `calc()` within media queries where the browser might misinterpret the context, resulting in layout inconsistencies across different screen sizes.
